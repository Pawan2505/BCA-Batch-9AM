Rules for Identifiers in C:
Start with a letter or an underscore:

An identifier must start with either an alphabet letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).

Example: totalAmount, _myVar, x1

Invalid: 1stVar, @value

Can contain letters, digits, and underscores:

After the first character, you can use letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), or underscores (_).

Example: total_Amount, var_1, data123

Invalid: var#name, my-var

Case-sensitive:

C identifiers are case-sensitive, meaning myvariable, MYVARIABLE, and MyVariable are considered different identifiers.

Example: age and Age are different.

Cannot be a reserved keyword:

Reserved keywords in C, such as int, return, if, while, for, float, char, etc., cannot be used as identifiers.

Invalid: int, return, while, for

No limit on length:

Technically, there is no limit on the length of an identifier in C, but in practice, some compilers may impose a limit (e.g., 31 characters for older compilers). However, it’s good practice to keep them concise and meaningful.

Example: this_is_a_long_identifier is valid, but excessive length may affect readability.

Cannot start with a digit:

An identifier cannot begin with a digit (0-9).

Invalid: 123variable, 2ndValue

Underscore and digit combination:

It is valid to use underscores and digits, but the identifier still cannot start with a digit.

Example: _var1, var_123

Avoid using underscores for standard library functions:

While not a rule enforced by the C language, it’s generally advisable to avoid starting your identifiers with an underscore (_), especially for library functions and macros, to avoid clashes with the standard library functions and macros that often use underscores (e.g., _getch, _exit).
